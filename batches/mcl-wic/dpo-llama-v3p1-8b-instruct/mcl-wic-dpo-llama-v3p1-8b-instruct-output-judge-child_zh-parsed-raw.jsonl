But it's not just like saying \"have\" or \"with\". It's a special way to say it in Chinese.\n\nFor example, if you have a toy, you can say \"我带有这个玩具\" (wǒ dāi yǒu zhè ge wán jù), which means \"I have this toy\". But if you're talking about something that is not a toy, like a feeling or a quality, you would use \"带有\" instead.\n\nFor instance, if someone is very kind, you can say \"他带有善心\" (tā dāi yǒu shàn xīn), which means \"He has a kind heart\".

If you're playing with a friend, you can say, \"Let's play 安全 games.\" This means you'll play games that won't hurt each other, like tag or hide-and-seek.\n\nSo, 安全 is like a special word that means something is protected, safe, or secure.", "avg_google_ngrams_frequency": 0.00014724338400028133, "definitions": ["安全 means 'safe' or 'secure', like a toy box that keeps toys from getting hurt or lost."], "category": "One", "remark_not_all_listed": false, "context_clarification_request": false, "complete_marker": false}

But it's not just about money. It can also mean the things you have to give up or do to get something else.\n\nFor example, if you really want to learn how to play the piano, you might have to practice every day, which means you won't have as much time to play with your friends. That's a \"代价\" - you're giving up something (free time) to get something else (the ability to play the piano).\n\nOr, if you want to buy a new bike, you might have to save up your allowance for a long time, which means you won't be able to buy something else you want right now. That's another \"代价\" - you're giving up something (spending money on something else) to get something else (the new bike).\n\nSo, \"代价\" is like a trade-off.

You need to make sure you choose the right one, the red ball, and not another toy.\n\nSo, \"确定\" means \"to confirm\" or \"to make sure\". It's like saying \"I'm sure\" or \"I confirm\". For example, if someone asks you if you want to eat a cookie, you can say \"确定\" (determine) to mean \"yes, I want a cookie\". Or, if you're playing a game, you can say \"确定\" to confirm that you want to play with a certain rule.\n\nBut, \"确定\" can also mean \"to decide\" or \"to determine\". For example, if you have to choose between two toys, you need to \"确定\" which one you want. So, it's like making a choice or a decision.\n\nThat's the main idea of \"确定\"!

If you live in the United States, then you are an \"美国国民\" (American citizen).

Sometimes, it means \"to confuse\" or \"to make someone confused\". For instance, if someone is trying to explain something to you, but it's hard to understand, you could say \"我搞乱了\" (wǒ gǎo luàn le), which means \"I'm confused\".\n\nLastly, in some cases, \"搞乱\" can also mean \"to make a big deal out of something\" or \"to exaggerate\". For example, if someone is making a big fuss about something that isn't a big deal, you could say \"他搞乱了\" (tā gǎo luàn le), which means \"He's making a big deal out of it\".\n\nSo, that's \"搞乱\" in a nutshell! 🎊", "avg_google_ngrams_frequency": 8.752590777732959e-07, "definitions": ["To mess up or make a mess, like throwing toys around a room", "To confuse someone or make them confused", "To make a big deal out of something or exaggerate"], "category": "Multiple", "remark_not_all_listed": true, "context_clarification_request": false, "complete_marker": true}

For example, if you poke a balloon, it will make a hole. If you poke someone, it might make them feel a little ouchie.\n2. **Thread**: Another meaning of 「扎」 is like a thread. Imagine you have a needle and thread, and you use it to sew something. The word 「扎」 sounds like the sound of the needle going in and out of the fabric. So, if you say someone is 「扎」, it means they are sewing or making something.\n3. **Hold**: In some cases, 「扎」 means to hold or grasp something. For example, if you hold a toy tightly, you can say you are 「扎」 it. It's like holding onto something with all your might.\n4. **Other meanings**: There are more meanings of 「扎」, but these are the main ones.

{"word": "声调", "model_response": "😊\n\nSo, you know how sometimes you can say a word and it can sound different? Like, \"ma\" can be \"mom\" or \"mat\"? That's because of something called \"tone\".\n\nTone is like a special flavor you can add to your voice when you say a word. It's like a secret ingredient that makes the word mean something different. In some languages, like Chinese, tone is super important. If you say a word with the wrong tone, it can mean something completely different! 🤯\n\nFor example, if you say \"ma\" with a flat tone, it means \"mother\". But if you say it with a rising tone, it means \"horse\". And if you say it with a falling tone, it means \"hemp\". Whoa, right? 🤯\n\nSo, tone is like a special way to make words have different meanings.

That's because the glass is transparent. We can see through it. If it were a thick, cloudy glass, we wouldn't be able to see the table. That would be like something that's not transparent.\n\nIn a way, \"透明性\" also means that something is honest or open. Like, if someone is transparent, they tell the truth and don't hide things. It's like a clear glass cup – we can see what's inside. If someone is not transparent, it's like a cloudy glass – we can't see what's really going on.\n\nSo, that's \"透明性\"!

But, you have different kinds of blocks, like red, blue, and green. So, you draw a line on the box to separate the red blocks from the blue blocks. That line is like a \"分界线\" (fēn jiè xiàn), which means \"boundary line\" or \"border\".\n\nIn the same way, we use lines to separate things in the world. For example, we have a line between the sky and the ground, or between the water and the land. We also have lines between countries, like borders. And sometimes, we even have lines in our own lives, like between our work and our free time.\n\nSo, a \"分界线\" is like a special line that helps us understand where things start and end, or where they are different.
