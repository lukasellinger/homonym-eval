So, God put the sky up there, and that's how we have a sky above us!\n\nAnother example is \"وَضَعَ الْأَرْض\" (wada' al-ard), which means \"He placed the earth\".

For example, if someone says \"أنا قَبْضَة\" (ana qabḍah), it means \"I am a finger\" (as in, a single finger).\n2. **Grip or hold**: In other cases, \"قَبْضَة\" can mean \"grip\" or \"hold\". For example, if someone says \"أمسكت قَبْضَة\" (amsaktu qabḍah), it means \"I took hold of something\" or \"I gripped something\".\n3. **A unit of measurement**: In some contexts, \"قَبْضَة\" is also used as a unit of measurement, similar to a \"hand\" or a \"span\". For example, if someone says \"قَبْضَة من الأرض\" (qabḍah min al-ʾarḍ), it means \"a hand's length\" or \"a span of land\".\n\nSo, that's \"قَبْضَة\" in a nutshell!

For example, if you have a big sandwich with two slices of bread, the filling is \"وَسَط\" (in the middle).\n\n**2. Time:** Think of a clock. \"وَسَط\" can also mean \"half\" or \"midpoint\" in time. For example, if you have a 12-hour clock, 6 o'clock is \"وَسَط\" (halfway between 0 and 12).\n\n**3. Comparison:** Sometimes, \"وَسَط\" is used to compare two things. For example, if you have two toys, one is \"أَكْبَر\" (bigger) and the other is \"أَقْصَى\" (smaller), the \"وَسَط\" one is the one that is \"in between\" (not the biggest or smallest).\n\n**4.

That's like \"تَحْرِير\" – you're free to do what you want, to make your own choices, and to live your life the way you want.\n\nIn a broader sense, \"تَحْرِير\" can also mean the freedom to express yourself, to speak your mind, or to be who you are without fear of judgment or criticism.

You \"خَرَجْت\" (kharaajt), which means you \"went out\" or \"came out\" from the playground.\n\nIn Arabic, \"خُرُوج\" (khuruj) is like that. It means \"to go out\" or \"to come out\" from something.

If you're in a car and you get out, you \"خَرَجْت\" from the car.\n\nBut \"خُرُوج\" can also mean \"to emerge\" or \"to appear.\" Imagine you're a butterfly inside a cocoon, and you come out as a beautiful butterfly.

The word is the same, but it means two totally different things.\n\nIn some cases, \"كُرَة\" can also mean a \"circle\" or a \"ring\". Like, if you draw a كُرَة around something, you're drawing a circle around it.\n\nSo, that's \"كُرَة\" in a nutshell! It's a word that can be a ball, the sun, or a circle, depending on the context.

Or, if you're talking to someone and they say \"إِيقَاف\" to you, it means they want you to stop what you're doing or saying.\n\nIn a more formal sense, \"إِيقَاف\" is also used in Arabic poetry and literature. In this context, it means \"to pause\" or \"to stop\" in the sense of a pause in the flow of words or ideas.

Okay! 🎉\n\n\"إِنْشَاء\" is a big word in Arabic that means \"to create\" or \"to make something happen\". Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and you want to build a castle. You take some LEGOs and connect them together to make a tower, then another tower, and another, until you have a beautiful castle. You \"created\" something new from the LEGOs, right? That's kind of like what \"إِنْشَاء\" means.\n\nIn the Quran, \"إِنْشَاء\" is used to describe how Allah (God) created the world and everything in it. It's like Allah took a big box of LEGOs and built the whole universe, including the stars, the moon, the sun, the animals, and even you and me! Isn't that amazing? 🤩\n\nSo, \"إِنْشَاء\" is a powerful word that reminds us of Allah's incredible power and wisdom.

Melody** (مُزِيق): In music, \"طَوِيل\" is used to describe a specific type of melody or song. It's like saying \"a long song\" or \"a slow song.\" For example, \"هذه الأغنية طويل\" (hāḏīhi al-ʾaġniyah tawīl) means \"This song is a slow song.\"\n\nSo, that's \"طَوِيل\" in a nutshell!

Imagine you did something naughty, like taking a toy from your friend without asking. Your mom or dad might say \"أَسْعَفَ\" to you, which means they are scolding you for what you did. It's like saying \"Oh no, no, no! You shouldn't have done that!\"\n\nIn some cases, \"أَسْعَفَ\" can also mean \"to be upset\" or \"to be annoyed\".

For example, if we take the word \"كلب\" (dog), and we add \"نِهائِيّ\" to the end, we get \"كلب نِهائِيّ\" (canine). So, it's like saying \"like a dog\" or \"similar to a dog\".\n\nBut that's not all! We can also use \"نِهائِيّ\" to make words that mean \"relating to\" something.

Now, if you want to say \"I took a toy from the box,\" you would use \"بَتَرَ\". It's like \"took\" or \"got\" or \"picked,\" but it's more like \"chose\" or \"selected.\" 🎀\n\nFor example, if you say \"بَتَرْتُ كِتَابًا\" (batara kitāban), it means \"I chose a book.\" If you say \"بَتَرْتُ لُبً\" (batara lubban), it means \"I chose a date.\" 🍎\n\nSo, \"بَتَرَ\" is like a special word that helps you say you picked something from a group of things.

It's like when you give someone else the responsibility to do something, like a job or a task. But, in a really important way, it's also about giving your trust to someone else, like God.\n\nFor example, in the Quran, it says that God is the one who \"تَفْوِيض\" (delegates) some tasks to the angels, like sending them to help people. So, it's like God is saying, \"Hey, I trust you, angels, to do this job for me.\"\n\nIn a way, when we pray, we are also \"تَفْوِيض\" our worries and problems to God, saying, \"I trust you to take care of this for me.\" It's like we're giving God the responsibility to handle things, and we're trusting that He will do what's best.\n\nSo, \"تَفْوِيض\" is a really important idea in Islam, because it reminds us that we don't have to do everything on our own.

That's kind of like what a \"سِلاح\" is, but instead of being a toy, it's a real thing that people use to help them in different situations.\n\nFor example, a \"سِلاح\" can be a gun, which is a tool that helps people protect themselves or their country from bad people.

In a similar way, Muslims have different ways of understanding and practicing their faith, and each of these ways is called a madhhab.\n\nThere were many great scholars who lived a long time ago who helped shape these different ways of thinking. Some of the most famous ones are:\n\n1. Hanafi: This madhhab is named after Imam Abu Hanifa, who lived in Baghdad. He was very good at understanding the Quran and the Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad). His followers believe that the Quran and Hadith are the most important sources of guidance.\n2.

Like, \"أنا صِلَة ماما\" (ana sila mama) means \"I am with Mommy.\"\n\nIn another way, \"صِلَة\" can also mean \"a bridge\" or \"a connection\" between two things.

The numbers before and after the colon (:) are called \"nisbah\" (relation).\n\n**Types of نِسْبَة (nisbah)**\n\nThere are two main types:\n\n1. **Mudraj (مُدْرَج)**: This is when the numbers are equal, like 1:1, 2:2, or 3:3. It means the parts are equal.\n2. **Ghair Mudraj (غَيْر مُدْرَج)**: This is when the numbers are not equal, like 2:3, 3:4, or 1:2. It means the parts are not equal.\n\n**Why is نِسْبَة (nisbah) important?**\n\nNisbah is crucial in Arabic because it helps us understand the relationships between words, phrases, and even numbers. For example:\n\n* In poetry, nisbah is used to describe the rhythm and meter of the verses.\n* In mathematics, nisbah is used to describe the ratio of two numbers.\n* In everyday life, nisbah is used to describe the relationship between two things, like \"father-son\" (father is to son as mother is to daughter).\n\n**Fun fact!**\n\nIn Arabic, the word \"نِسْبَة\" itself has a special nisbah: 1:2!

For example, if someone does something wrong, someone else might say \"ما صَالِح\" (it's not right).

For instance, if someone does something nice for you, like helping you carry your heavy backpack, you might say \"شكراً لك، هذه مكافأة\" (shukraan lak, hādhihi mukāfā'ah), which means \"Thank you, this is a reward\" – implying that their kindness is a reward in itself.\n\nSo, in short, \"مكافأة\" is like a reward or compensation, but it can also be used to express gratitude or appreciation for something.", "evaluation": {"definitions": ["A reward or compensation for doing something good, like helping or working hard", "An expression of gratitude or appreciation for someone's kindness"], "category": "Multiple", "definition_explanation": "The response provides two distinct meanings of 'مكافأة': one as a reward for actions (like helping or working hard) and another as a way to express gratitude for kindness.

It's like the word has two different meanings, just like how you have two eyes! 🤩\n\nWhen we talk about a spring, like the season, \"عَيْن\" means the time of year when plants start growing again. It's like when you see flowers blooming and the weather gets warmer. It's a beautiful time!\n\nBut when we talk about the \"eye\" part, it's more like the center or the source of something. For example, if you have a well or a fountain, the \"عَيْن\" is the source of the water. It's like the \"eye\" of the well, where the water comes from.\n\nSo, that's \"عَيْن\" in a nutshell!

You know how we use pictures to represent things, like a heart for love or a smiley face for happiness? An \"علامة\" is like that, but for words! 🤔\n\nIn Arabic, \"علامة\" means \"sign\" or \"symbol\", and it can be used in different ways. Sometimes, it means a sign or a mark, like a letter or a picture. But sometimes, it can also mean a sign or a signal, like a warning or a message. For example, if someone is waving a flag, that's like an \"علامة\" to signal something. 🏴\n\nIn the Quran, \"علامة\" is also used to mean a sign or a miracle, like when God does something amazing to show His power. So, it's like a special sign that shows something is true or important. 🌟\n\nSo, that's what \"علامة\" is! It's like a special word that can mean different things depending on the context.

It's a special kind of pleasure or enjoyment that people do for fun, but it's not the same as the fun things you do as a kid.\n\nIn Islam, \"مُتْعَة\" is a word that means \"pleasure\" or \"enjoyment.\" It can refer to things like listening to music, watching a funny movie, or even just spending time with friends. But sometimes, some people use the word to talk about things that are not good for them, like drinking too much or doing things that are not allowed in Islam.\n\nSo, it's important to remember that \"مُتْعَة\" is not always a good thing.

You would \"remove\" it from the box, right? That's kind of like what \"إِسْقَاط\" means.\n\nIn a more serious sense, \"إِسْقَاط\" can also mean \"dismissal\" in a job or a position. For example, if someone is a teacher and they don't do their job well, the school might \"dismiss\" them, which means they won't be a teacher there anymore.\n\nIn Arabic, the word \"إِسْقَاط\" is used in many other contexts too, like in science, where it means \"fall\" or \"drop\", like when something falls from the sky.

For example, if someone asks you to define what a certain word means, you would be \"تَحْدِيد\" that word by explaining its meaning.\n\nIn a more poetic sense, \"تَحْدِيد\" can also mean \"to shape\" or \"to form\".
