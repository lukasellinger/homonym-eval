So, \"superior\" means something is better than something else.\n\n2. **Higher up**: If you look at a map, you might see a river and a lake. The river is \"superior\" to the lake because it's higher up. It starts at the lake and flows down. So, \"superior\" can also mean something is higher in position or level.\n\n3. **A special name**: There's a lake in the United States called Lake Superior. It's the biggest of the Great Lakes.

That's because the light bulb inside the flashlight is called a \"flash\" because it flashes (or turns on and off) really fast. So, the name \"flash\" comes from the light flashing.\n\n**2. Camera Flash:** When you take a picture with a camera, sometimes it makes a bright light. This is called a \"flash\" too! It's like a little light that helps make the picture brighter, especially in dark places. It's like a tiny flashlight that helps the camera see better.\n\n**3. Computer/Internet:** Sometimes, when you're playing games or watching videos on a computer or phone, you might see a \"flash\" on the screen.
