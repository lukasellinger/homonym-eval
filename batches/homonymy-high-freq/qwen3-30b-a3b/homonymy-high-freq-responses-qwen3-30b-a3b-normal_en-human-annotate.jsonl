{"word": "mass", "model_response": "**Mass** is a fundamental property of matter that quantifies the amount of matter in an object. It is a measure of an object's **inertia** (resistance to acceleration when a force is applied) and its **gravitational interaction** (the strength of the gravitational force it exerts and experiences). \n\n### Key Characteristics:\n1. **Inertial Mass**:  \n   - Determines how much an object resists changes in its motion (Newton's first law). The greater the mass, the more force is required to accelerate it.\n\n2. **Gravitational Mass**:  \n   - Determines the strength of the gravitational force between objects (Newton's law of universal gravitation). It also defines how much gravity an object exerts on others.\n\n3. **Equivalence Principle**:  \n   - Inertial and gravitational mass are experimentally indistinguishable and are considered equivalent in physics (a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of general relativity).\n\n4. **SI Unit**:  \n   - The standard unit of mass is the **kilogram (kg)**.\n\n### Distinction from Weight:\n- **Mass** is an intrinsic property and remains constant regardless of location.  \n- **Weight** is the force exerted on an object due to gravity (e.g., weight = mass × gravitational acceleration). It varies depending on the gravitational field (e.g., an object's weight on the Moon is less than on Earth).\n\n### Advanced Context:\n- In **relativity**, mass is related to energy via Einstein's equation $ E = mc^2 $, where mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. However, this is typically beyond basic definitions unless specified.\n\nIn summary, mass is a measure of the \"quantity of matter\" and its resistance to acceleration, central to both classical mechanics and modern physics.", "human_evaluation": {"category": "One", "context_clarification_request": false, "remark_not_all_listed": false}}
