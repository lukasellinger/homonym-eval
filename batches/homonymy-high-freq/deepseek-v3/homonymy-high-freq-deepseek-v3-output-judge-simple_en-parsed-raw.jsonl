Addition is also associative (the grouping doesn’t matter) and commutative (the order doesn’t matter). There’s an **additive identity** (like 0) and every element has an **additive inverse** (like -a for a).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: The set is closed under multiplication, meaning if you multiply any two elements, the result is still in the set. Multiplication is associative, but it doesn’t have to be commutative (the order can matter). There’s a **multiplicative identity** (like 1) in some rings, but not all.\n\n3. **Distributive Property**: Multiplication distributes over addition, meaning \\( a \\cdot (b + c) = a \\cdot b + a \\cdot c \\).\n\nIn summary, a ring is a set where you can add, subtract, and multiply elements in a way that follows these rules.
